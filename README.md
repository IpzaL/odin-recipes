First project with Odin Project.

I have put to work a lot of the things I have learnt so far during this course, creating a webpage from scratch, linking different pages/images and lists just to name a few. 

One big thing I forgot to do was keep up with my commits during the creation of the webpage which made it look like it appeared out of thin air so I now understand why commits are important and to keep on top of them.

Overall this has been a great starting project and I have learnt a lot.
